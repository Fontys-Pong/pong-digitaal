TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock ZYNQ_i/blockdesign_0/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_ZYNQ_clk_wiz_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_ZYNQ_clk_wiz_0 and clk_hdmi_blockdesign_inst_0_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_ZYNQ_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_hdmi_blockdesign_inst_0_clk_wiz_0_0_1]

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock ZYNQ_i/blockdesign_0/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin ZYNQ_i/blockdesign_0/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_out1_ZYNQ_clk_wiz_0 and clk_hdmi_blockdesign_inst_0_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '6' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
