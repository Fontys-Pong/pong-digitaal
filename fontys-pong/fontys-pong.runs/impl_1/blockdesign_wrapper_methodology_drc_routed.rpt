TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock blockdesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin blockdesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_out1_blockdesign_clk_wiz_0 and clk_hdmi_blockdesign_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.

There is a large setup violation of -9.874 ns between blockdesign_i/paint_scoreboard/scoreboard_controller_0/U0/seg_l_pos_x_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_out1_blockdesign_clk_wiz_0) and blockdesign_i/paint_scoreboard/paint_seg_l/paint_rectangle_1/U0/pxl_value_o_reg/D (clocked by clk_hdmi_blockdesign_clk_wiz_0_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '6' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
